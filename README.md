# MasterProject

## Collaboration Rules :

**1: Pulls Requests HAVE TO be reviewed by the assigned reviewer and updated by the assigned developer before closing and merging the pull request**

**2: NEVER merge into "main" branch but when a main feature has been completed, reviewed and certified as stable**

**3: Anytime a feature or a bug is completed, the branch should be merged to develop, which will be the main branch of the project. (Main will be for stable versions, milestone completions)**

**4: Every branches have to be named such as :**

	 - feature/nickname_<feature_name>
		for a feature
	 - hotfix/nickname_<bug_name>
		for bug fixing

 **5: Merged branches should be safely deleted after a successful merge**
 
**6: Every commit should be properly named and describe precisely what has been done**

**7: A branch should has only one feature**
> When a part of a feature is completed, this part should be commited.
> The developer of the feature can push his work whenever he wants, so it can be reviewed in advance by the collaborator
